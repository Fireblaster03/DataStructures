## Objectives
* Implemented **Dijkstra's SSSP** on adjacency list data structure.
    * adjacency list stores an **undirected** graph where vertices are represented by strings.
    * Uses the edge list data in */data/RC_2019-02-01_edges.ndjson*
    * In the ndjson file, *i* and *j* are edge endpoints, and *w* is the edge weight
